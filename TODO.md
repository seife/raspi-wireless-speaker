Ideas for future development

   * only set `pairable on` after some event (button press?) and set a timeout for it
   * automatically disable the internal sound card and enable the USB sound card, so that the initial confiuration with `pavucontrol` is not needed
      * OTOH maybe people want to use the HDMI output for audio...
   * "Volume buttons", maybe wired to GPIOs?
   * "Sink select buttons" to switch the output
   * WPS button for Push-button WiFi config
   * Display for UPNP Stream metadata / Bluetooth pairing information?
   * Web frontend for configuring stuff (audio sink, volume, ...?)
